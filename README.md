## The Problem
Irrigation inefficiency is one of the leading causes of water wastage and crop damage in agriculture. Studies show that nearly **60% of irrigation water is wasted** due to overwatering, while crops also suffer significantly from under-irrigation, reducing yields and harming soil health. Farmers often rely on guesswork instead of precise data, leading to poor resource utilization and crop loss.  

## Introduction  
**Project Trupti** is a smart, multilingual AI-powered assistant designed to help farmers plan irrigation effectively and sustainably. It bridges the complexity of advanced data analysis with the simplicity of natural human interaction, enabling farmers to save water, protect crops, and adapt to changing weather conditions.

- Multilingual support with seamless conversations in the farmer's chosen language.  
- User flow: Greets → Collects key parameters (crop type, soil type, location, irrigation method) → Fetches real-time and forecasted weather data → Builds an optimized irrigation plan tailored for water conservation and crop health.  
- Farmers can ask questions at any time, and the agent responds contextually, avoiding confusion.  
- Accessible via regular phone calls without requiring internet connectivity.  

### WhatsApp Assistant  
- Companion chat assistant for discussing irrigation and agricultural plans.  
- Provides quick access to daily irrigation schedules and guidance.
